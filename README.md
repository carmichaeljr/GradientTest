# GradientTest
A test to see if greadients could be made in tkinter

This script needs python 3 or greater installed.

A linear gradient is just the linear change of the individual rgb values to get from color X to color Y. This script does exactly that, it takes two colors, calculates the rate of change needed to get from the r, g, and b values of color X to the r,g, and b values of color Y, and uses those equations to display a gradient on the screen.

Pressing the 'Run Gradients!' button will dynamicly change the values of X and Y to display the differences in the gradients.

The purpose of this was, as stated in the title, to test whether or not gradients could be draw in in tkinter. This proves they can, and will be a welcome addition to future GUI projects.
